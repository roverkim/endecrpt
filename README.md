# endecrpt

Endecrypt is node application that encrypts and decrypts a word with a secret word or phrase. Created to use with word based cryptocurrency wallet backup.

Online version to come.

## Note
*Never* store your secret phrase online. Remember it by heart. I recommend running the application once for the first 12 words. Save and rename results.txt. Repeat the process for the next 12 words. Store both txt in 2 different locations.


## Installation
Endecrypt can be downloaded by cloning this repository `https://github.com/roverkim/endecrpt_cryptocurrency.git`

After installation, open node and run `npm install` in the local file location.

To run Endecrypt, type `node index.js`
